BORG-RSH-LOCAL - emulate ssh connection for local borg repository.

Background
----------
Borgbackup[1,2] can use a remote shell (ssh) connection from the dumping
client to the server containing the repository.
eg
clntuser@client $ borg create -x dumpuser@repohost:/borg-repo::example /example

Here the user clntuser is creating a repo on repohost as user dumpuser by

	ssh dumpuser@repohost borg serve --umask 077

The actual ssh command can be specified on the borg command line (--rsh)
or via the BORG_RSH environment variable.

When the client and repository are on the same machine but are different
users - client is root (to access all files) and remote is dumpuser
(for consistency with remote backups or where the repository is an NFS
mounted volume and root_squash is in effect) one suggestion is to use
ssh to localhost
eg
root@repohost# borg init -e none dumpuser@localhost:/borg-repo/example

which has the overhead of creating clients ssh keys and configuring
~dumpuser/.ssh/authorized_keys which for a root client is redundant.
In addition there are extra ssh and a sshd process between the borg
client and borg backend.

Borg-rsh-local
--------------
borg-rsh-local emulates enough of a ssh connection between the borg
client (running as root) and the borg backend running as dumpuser but
unlike ssh-sshd removes itself by an execve(2) of the borg backend.

Typical use with /sbin/opt/borg-rsh-local

root@repohost# borg init --rsh "/sbin/opt/borg-rsh-local -r /borg" -e none \
				dumpuser@localhost:/borg/borg-repo
#With BORG_RSH
root@repohost# export BORG_RSH="/sbin/opt/borg-rsh-local -r /borg"
root@repohost# borg create -x dumpuser@repohost:/borg-repo::example /example

NOTES
-----
borg-rsh-local refuses to execve(2) the borg backend as root.

The -r /directory option of borg-rsh-local is passed to the
--restrict-to-path  option of the borg serve backend.

borg-rsh-local constructs the SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND environment variable
emulating ssh.

BUGS
----
Doubtless legion.
